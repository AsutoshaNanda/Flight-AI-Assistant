## What is this repo?

`Flight AI Assistant` is a **playful yet powerful** chatbot that demonstrates how to blend large‚Äëlanguage‚Äëmodel chat (OpenAI GPT‚Äë4o‚Äëmini, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini) with **function‚Äëcalling tools** to fetch **real‚Äëtime, reliable data**.  
Think of it as a virtual airline agent that never makes up ticket prices‚Äîbecause the prices live in a tiny, well‚Äëstructured Python dictionary (or a future live API).

> **TL;DR:** *Chat with a model, let it call Python functions for you, and get spot‚Äëon answers.*

## Why function‚Äëcalling tools are the secret sauce?

| ‚úÖ Benefit | üéØ What it means for you |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Separation of concerns** | The system prompt handles tone (courteous, one‚Äësentence answers). The tools handle the hard facts (prices, discounts). |
| **Zero hallucinations** | The model never guesses a price; it *must* call `get_ticket_price` or `get_discounted_price`. |
| **Structured, JSON‚Äëfriendly data** | Responses are machine‚Äëreadable, no fragile regex parsing required. |
| **Easy extensibility** | Add a new function ‚Üí update its JSON schema ‚Üí append to `tools`. No system‚Äëprompt rewrites! |
| **Auditability** | Every tool call can be logged for compliance or debugging. |
| **Security by design** | The model never gets direct DB or network access‚Äîonly the curated functions you expose. |

## Core Architecture ‚Äì A Quick Tour

`````
User ‚Üí Gradio UI ‚Üí chat() ‚Üí OpenAI API
           ‚Üò (no tool)               ‚Üò (tool call)
             ‚Üò                         ‚Üò
        OpenAI response          handle_tool_call()
             ‚Üò                         ‚Üò
   UI displays answer   tool response ‚Üí second OpenAI call ‚Üí final answer
`````

* **`system_message`** ‚Äì sets the personality: short, courteous, always accurate.  
* **Tool definitions** ‚Äì JSON schemas (`price_function`, `discount_function`) describing the callable Python functions.  
* **`chat()`** ‚Äì orchestrates the conversation, decides when a tool call is needed, and stitches everything together.  
* **`handle_tool_calls()`** ‚Äì parses the model‚Äôs tool request, runs the real Python function, and builds the tool‚Äëresponse payload.  
* **Gradio UI** ‚Äì a sleek web front‚Äëend (`gr.ChatInterface`) for instant testing.

## New Feature Spotlight: **Discount‚ÄëFor‚ÄëSales** Tool ‚ú®

### What‚Äôs new?
We‚Äôve added a **second tool** that returns **discounted ticket prices** for special promotions (Black Friday, Christmas sales, etc.).  

### How it works
1. **User asks** ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the sale price for a Tokyo ticket?‚Äù  
2. The model sees the `discount_function` schema, decides to call it.  
3. `handle_tool_calls()` runs `get_discounted_price(city)` against the `discount_prices` dict.  
4. The model receives the JSON result and crafts a short, friendly reply like:  

> ‚ÄúA Tokyo round‚Äëtrip is currently on sale for **$999** üéâ‚Äù

### Tool definition (for nerds)

```python
discount_function = {
    "name": "get_discounted_price",
    "description": "Get the discounted price of a return ticket to the destination city. Use this during sales periods (e.g., Black Friday, Christmas).",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "destination_city": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The city the customer wants to travel to."
            }
        },
        "required": ["destination_city"],
        "additionalProperties": False,
    },
}
tools += [{"type": "function", "function": discount_function}]
```

Now the assistant can **smoothly switch** between regular and discounted pricing without any extra prompt gymnastics.

## Getting Started ‚Äì Run It Locally in 5 Minutes

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AsutoshaNanda/Flight-AI-Assistant.git
   cd Flight-AI-Assistant
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   .\venv\Scripts\activate                          # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install openai anthropic google-generativeai gradio python-dotenv beautifulsoup4
   ```

4. **Add your API keys** in a `.env` file at the project root:  
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
   ```

5. **Launch the notebook or script**  
   *Notebook*: `jupyter lab` ‚Üí open `Flight AI Assistant.ipynb` ‚Üí run all cells.  
   *Script*: copy the notebook code into a `app.py` and run `python app.py`.

6. **Open the Gradio UI** (usually at `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) and start chatting!

## Extending the Assistant ‚Äì Add Your Own Magic

1. **Write a Python function** ‚Äì e.g., `def get_flight_status(flight_number): ...`  
2. **Create a matching tool schema** (name, description, JSON parameters).  
3. **Append it to the `tools` list**.  
4. **Update `handle_tool_calls()`** to route the new `function.name` to your Python function.  

*Tip:* Keep the function **pure** (no side‚Äëeffects) and **validate inputs** (whitelist city names, regex flight numbers) for security.

## Best‚ÄëPractices, Gotchas & Tips

| üéØ Area | ‚úÖ Recommendation |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Infinite loops** | Limit `max_tool_calls` per turn (e.g., 2) to avoid recursion. |
| **Schema mismatches** | Test tool schemas in OpenAI Playground before coding. |
| **User‚Äësupplied data** | Sanitize/whitelist all arguments inside your functions. |
| **Deprecation warnings** | Use `type='messages'` in `gr.ChatInterface` (as shown). |
| **Rate limits** | Implement exponential back‚Äëoff & exponential jitter for API calls. |
| **Debugging** | Print/log the raw `tool_calls` payload to see exactly what the model sent. |
| **Fun factor** | Sprinkle emojis, friendly language, and short sentences (the system prompt already enforces it!). |
